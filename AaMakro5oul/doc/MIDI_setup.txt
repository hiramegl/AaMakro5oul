MIDI setup in MAC OS
---------------------

Hi,

I think there is already a thread called MIDI help but doesn't seem to have a happy end :(
I would like to be a able to send MIDI messages to my Ableton Live application but I cannot manage to
configure Open Stage Control correctly after reading the documentation. :'(

Might be that I am asking super dummy questions but hope you guys could be patient :)

I have a mac (Sierra 10.13) where I run Ableton Live 9 and in the same computer i have an Open Stage Control
server running. I open the web GUI from a tablet to send OSC messages and update the GUI receiving messages
from Ableton Live. Everything works like a charm but I have a new challenge.

I develop my application reading the unofficial python API documentation for Ableton Live and by checking
some other example scripts. So far so good, but now I need to send MIDI messages cause it seems that
Ableton Live does not expose all methods to change the state of some features from their python API.
Luckily it seems that I can map some of these buttons with MIDI events :-)

The problem now is that I have not managed to start my Open Stage Control server with MIDI support.

So the questions are:
- I have ran 'pip install rtmidi' and I see the package in the list but I am suspecting I need to uninstall
  it and install it manually making sure this is fulfilled: "compiled with --jack-midi flag for JACK MIDI support"
- Do I need to uninstall it and compile it and install rtmidi manually?
  When I open the server GUI I see that in the "midi" field there is "midi routing settings (requires python-pyo)".
- Do I need to install python-pyo? I don't seem to find it in any repository. I have downloaded
  "pyo_0.9.0_OSX_py2-universal.dmg" from the company that develops python-pyo but it did not install any python
  library from what I understood. It seems to be a standalone application only.

When I manage to configure the MIDI in Open Stage Control, what would be the next step to link a button with
Ableton Live? I saw in the documentation I need to write "midi:<device_name>".
How do I find the <device_name> for Ableton Live?
Do I need to configure something in Ableton Live?
Maybe the only problem is that I am not very familiar with the MIDI interface, OSC was "easier" to understand
as is a server-client relation.

Sorry for the long message but hopefully anybody has some tips or links where I can find a bit more information
cause I feel a bit lost :-(

Thanks again for the great product you build guys!

Cheers,

/Hiram

Hi Hiram, thank you for the clear and detailed post !

Do I need to uninstall it and compile it and install rtmidi manually?
Only if you use jack to manage your midi connections.

Do I need to install python-pyo ?
No, only rtmidi is required. I should have removed this old requirement from the docs a long time ago
actually... done :)

[...]
device_name is an arbitrary name you choose : it refers to a pair of midi input/output defined by passing
device_name:input,output to open stage control's midi option, where input and output are midi port numbers
you can find out by passing list to the midi option (this will make the console print available midi ports
including Ableton's, I guess).

If you are familiar with virtual midi ports, you could spare the hassle of finding out the port numbers
(which may change depending on how many devices are connected) by using virtual midi ports: device_name:virtual
will open a pair of virtual midi input/output ports you should be able to connect to Ableton's.

I'm not an OSX or Ableton user myself so I can't be much more specific unfortunately, but I've read OSX
supports virtual midi ports.

Hi Jean!

Thanks again for the help!
I started by creating a virtual midi port. It seems there is an application in Mac called "Audio MIDI setup"
where is possible to create virtual midi ports, as you wrote.

I activated the "IAC Driver" and created a virtual port "AbletonLive". Then I saw it showed up when running
the Open Stage Control server with "-m list" option.

All is working fine now, the only thing is that when I wrote "AbletonLive:1,1" to configure the midi options
the Open Stage Control GUI crashed. But it worked like a charm when I ran all the options in the command line.
Very weird.

I will continue running Open Stage Control from the command line, just wonder if I am writing wrong parameters
in the GUI.

Thanks for your help!
Greetings,

/Hiram

Sorry for getting back to you after such a long time. It seems the problem is trivial : the main process stops
when it receives setup errors from the python process, I'm changing this so that the main process stays alive
and shows the error in the GUI's console.
